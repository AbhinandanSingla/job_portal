# Introduction
***

The Job Portal project was created during the Smart India Hackathon as a web application that aims to connect job
seekers with employers. It is built using the Express.js framework on the server-side and React.js on the client-side.
The project provides a platform where job seekers can find job vacancies and apply for them, while employers can post
job listings and manage applications efficiently.
